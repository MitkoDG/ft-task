# FT Market Data

FT Market Data is a web application that retrieves and displays financial market data from the Financial Times API. It allows users to view the latest information.
The application fetches data from the Financial Times API and presents it in a user-friendly format. Users can see the names of the securities, their corresponding values, and the percentage change in value over a specific time period. The data is updated regularly to provide real-time information to users.

## Project Requirements

This project addresses the following requirements:

- Implement a JavaScript application that fetches data from an API and displays it on the page.
- Use modern JavaScript syntax, such as ES modules, async/await, and arrow functions.
- Organize the code into separate modules for better maintainability.
- Write unit tests using a testing framework (Mocha) and assertion library (Chai).
- Use media queries to make the application responsive and adjust the layout based on different screen sizes.
- Handle and display error messages to the user in case of API failures or invalid data.

Additionally, the README file contains other relevant information about the project, such as installation instructions, how to run the application, and any other important details.
